          <p class="pBody">Family estrangement is the physical or emotional distancing
            between at least two family members in an arrangement which is usually
            considered unsatisfactory by at least one involved party. Family estrangements
            can be attributed to any of several factors within the family, such as
            attachment disorders, differing values and beliefs, disappointment,
            major life events or change, or poor communication.  In one typical scenario,
            an adult child ceases contact with his or her parents and possibly other
            family members as the adult child transitions into adulthood.
            In another scenario, an intolerant parent casts out an adult child
            because of life choices. </p>

        <p>The idea of selfless service is an important concept in a number
          of religions because God is perceived as having an interest in the
          well-being of others as well as oneself; serving other people is considered
          an essential devotional practice of indirectly serving God and living
          a religious life that is a benefit to others.  When kids learn to put
          others first the whole family benefits and excels.  Studies have show that when
          a child participates in the family chores at an early age the significantly decrease
          their changes to become a mass-murderer.  90% of kids who particpate in family chores
          make the honor role at their school.  The other 10% are just serving to get their own way,
          they really only have every cared about themselves and no one else.  Therefore, this game
          helps prevent the breakdown of our society into utter chaos.  Do you want your kids to part
          of the problem or part of the solution?</p>

        <p class="pBody">Symptoms from complete isolation, called sensory deprivation, often
          include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions of time and perception.
          However, this is the case when there is no stimulation of the sensory systems at all,
          and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other things to
          keep one's mind busy, this is avoided.  Still, long-term solitude is
          often seen as undesirable, causing loneliness or reclusion resulting from
          inability to establish relationships. Furthermore, it might even lead
          to clinical depression.  In contrast, some psychological conditions are
          strongly linked to a tendency to seek solitude. In animal experiments,
          solitude has been shown to cause psychosis.  You can prevent these horrible
          mental states in your kids...but are you willing to take the plunge?
